## TLDR

TLDR of the project is to deploy a web application, built with Next.js to be an API and a public facing website to display the recent earthquakes in Iran and close proximity regions. In addition to next.js app, there will be a packaged application with Capacitor.js to build a vite React SPA for android ( it should be possible to build the application for other platforms, but might not be possible with the short time window ). All the source code will be inside a single mono repository.

## Why?

As of 20st july 2022, Iranian Seismological Center website lacks, ssl certificate, responsible design for mobile devices, and any sort of modern design, goal of this project is to make a better version for regular users.

## Deployment method

Deployment will be standardized with docker, therefore hosting progress will be the same across the different hosts. Currently the web version is hosted on https://earthquake-monitoring.amir4rab.com and the pwa version is hosted on https://pwa.earthquake-monitoring.amir4rab.com.

## Development setup ðŸ’»

### Requirements

- Node.js ( 18.7.0 or higher )
- pnpm ( 7.9.0 or higher )
- Docker ( 20.10.17 or higher )
- Docker compose ( 1.29.2 or higher )

### development databases

you need to run the following commands to start databases in docker

```bash
cd /docker
# You might need to change "docker compose" to "docker-compose"
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Web development ( needs database to be online )

you need to run the following commands to start a development server:

```bash
cd /web
pnpm install # Installing dependencies
pnpm run init-prisma-schema # Generating prisma types
pnpm run prisma-migrate-dev # Applying schemas to database
pnpm run dev # Starting the development server
```

### Mobile development ( needs web to be online )

you need to run the following commands to do the initial setup:

```bash
cd /mobile
pnpm install # Installing dependencies
pnpm run prisma-types # generating prisma types
```

Then you can start PWA development by the following command

```bash
pnpm run pwa-dev # Starting the development server
```

Or run the following command to start dev server with android env files

```bash
pnpm run android-dev # Starting the development server
```

### Cronjob ( needs database to be online )

you need to run the following commands to start a development server:

```bash
cd /web
pnpm install # Installing dependencies
pnpm run init-prisma-schema # Generating prisma types
pnpm run prisma-migrate-dev # Applying schemas to database
pnpm run dev # Starting the development server
```

## Hosting ðŸ”¥

### software requirements:

- Docker ( 20.10.17 or higher )
- Docker compose ( 1.29.2 or higher )

### Hardware requirements:

- Storage: 5G or more
- Ram: 512mg or more
- Cpu: 2cores or more

### Guide

you need to run the following commands to start hosting server, keep in mind in case your server user is root, you need to make some changes in web [Dockerfile](./web/Dockerfile). Before hosting your application you have to update couples of env files in "compose.prod.yml", we recommend making a copy of the original file and applying your changes to the copied version.

```bash
cd /docker
cp  docker-compose.prod.yml docker-compose.local.yml # then update the new file and add your env files
# You might need to change "docker compose" to "docker-compose"
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```
